Project Description:
In this project, I will analyze the Social Spending of OECD countries from 1980 to 2015. In particular, I will focus on Japan, who currently has a very high medium age, and the US, whose population medium age is expected to grow. This project will be broken down into three sections. The first section will analyze overall Social Spending trends including the Net Social Spending of Japan and United States, the CAGR of Social Spending by OECD countries, Average Social Spending by OECD countries. The second section will break down the Social Spending of Japan and the United States by sector, and I will specifically focus on Old Age Social Spending trends. The final section will focus on the Medium Age trends in Japan and the United States and how they are correlated to Old Age Social Spending in both countries.
