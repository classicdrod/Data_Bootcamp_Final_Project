    "## Final Project: Medium Age influence on Social Spending in Japan and The United States\n",

    "#### Abstract:\n",
    "In this project, I will analyze the Social Spending of OECD countries from 1980 to 2015. In particular, I will focus on Japan, who currently has a very high medium age, and the US, whose population medium age is expected to grow. This project will be broken down into three sections. The first section will analyze overall Social Spending trends including the Net Social Spending of Japan and United States, the CAGR of Social Spending by OECD countries, Average Social Spending by OECD countries. The second section will break down the Social Spending of Japan and the United States by sector, and I will specifically focus on Old Age Social Spending trends. The final section will focus on the Medium Age trends in Japan and the United States and how they are correlated to Old Age Social Spending in both countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "This project is prompted by the idea that social spending in the US is expected to increase as people are living longer and medium age is increasing. Furthermore, social spending will be a key driver in increasing the Fiscal Deficit within the US, which brings the question whether the deficit is sustainable. AS defined by the OECD, Social Expenditures or Social Spending comprise of cash benefits, direct in-kind provision of goods and services, and tax breaks with social purposes. These Social Expenditures comprise of benefits targeted toward low-income households, the elderly, sick, unemployed and young people. In the US, Government spending is projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.5 percent over the next decade, reaching $7.0 trillion in 2028. From this increase, spending from Social Security, Medicare, and Net interest account for more than two-thirds of that increase ([CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53766)). The aging of the population is a large factor in the increase of overall Social Expenditure. The United States stands to learn by analyzing Japan economic decisions to counteract an ageing population. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Report\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, in order to analyze Social Spending and Medium Age trends,  I will need to use public data on social spending provided by the [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/). Specifically, I will use both a [general social spending database](https://data.oecd.org/socialexp/social-spending.htm) and an [aggregated social expenditure database](https://stats.oecd.org/BrandedView.aspx?oecd_bv_id=socx-data-en&doi=data-00166-en) provided by the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD)](https://data.oecd.org/). From the general social spending database, I will extract general social spending trends from a few OECD countries. From the aggreagated social expenditure database, I will extract specific aspects of Japan's and the United States's social expenditures by breaking it down into large components. To analyze Medium Age trends, I will use the [United Nations Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/) to get a database showing the population trends of Japan and the United States. All these databases will be read into this notebook and cleaned, mergedm and extracted for my use.\n",

    "The correlation for increasing Medium Age with Old Age Social spending in Japan is incredibly high at a correlation coefficient of r = 0.955. From this basic information, we can begin making a hypothesis about increasing medium age as a factor of social spending. The US similarly has a large correlation coefficient at r = 0.918. Although we do not have enough data to make a solid claim about medium age as a coefficient for increased Old Age Social Spending, we can at least hypothesize that it is a large factor. "

    "### [Conclusion:](#section8)\n",
    "In this project, I analyzed the general social spending behavior of OECD countries to narrow down large factors within social spending. I learned that Old Age related social spending is the largest social spending component for Japan and the second largest for the US. From this, I hypothesized that Japan's Old Age Social Spending may be higher because of a higher medium age. I tested this in a linear regression and it turns out the Japan's old age social spending has a higher correlation with a higher medium age than does the US's. This report functions as an initial insight into a larger issue stemming from the projected growth of social spending. In the future, social spending in the US is expected to run the US into a deep Fiscal Deficit. This report hopefully provided an initial insight into how the US could potentially learn from Japan's population issue, which is expected to become an issue for the US. "
